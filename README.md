# Databricks
#####AI Brick - Solves domain specific problem with your own data
1. upload your data to unity catalog volume  
2. Go to AI Builder - (beta) option in databricks  
3. click on information extractor  
4. select your file  
5. Give the info you wish to extract - json will work  
6. Give agent name  
7. Eg., Give 1000s of receipts from business trips etc..  Complex use cases to skip architecture problems (but can we change models)
8. Looks for description & recommendation part  
9. Use the power of generative ai/language model to change description and get particular response  
10. Imgaine yourself as bank with millions of invoices and quality services  
11. use agent - will pop up pre-defined sql , you can run to extract information  
12. check whether output is structured by us or the input is standarised
13. you bring data in your env. just like snowflake - helps in data governance, can have the file in delta format.  
14. Can use optimization of ai runs and evaluate further  
#####  Step2 - Rapid Prototyping  
1. Using Playground and Genie  - how to use my own data to shape my ai  
2. Playgorund - ability to compare models side-by-side  
3. Playground- select and endpoint - select your models  
4. Pay-per-token  
5. Can put models side by side, give sync. prompt and get output  
6. Will apply AI Judges and suggest follow-up-question  
7. Tools- add tools - calculate fibonacci - python code backend  
8. Create agent notebook - have all the logic we created in playground, call to models, invokiung functions etc..  
####  Unity Catalogue  
-> Unity catalogue is a superplace for everything related AI, tables, models, functions   
-> How to register your tool to unity catalogue to invoke it  
##### Genie room  
-> has context and instructions you provide   
-> give your data, prompt, get visuals, derive meaning, give context  
-> Northwind database  
-> Define your own terms, terminology, chats  
### Mosiac AI Agent Framework and Agent Evaluation  

-> use review app, get reference, train model again, ai judge  
-> teach your agent what good input is, becomes inference table  
-> use evaluation dataset and ML Flow to review evaluation  
-> listen to ai judges and get iterated  

##### Agents orchestrating other agents
-> is it integrating with other platform agents ?
