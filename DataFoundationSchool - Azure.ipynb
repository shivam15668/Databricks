    "### When to use Azure SQL Data warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Most appropriate when you need to keep         historical data separate from source transaction system for performance reasons </li> \n",
    "<li> lots of read, write </li>\n",
    "<li> grow or shrink compute power without moving data </li>\n",
    "<li> can pause compute capacity, cost for only storage </li>\n",
    "<li> resume compute during operational hours</li>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Massive Parallel Processing Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Control node -> MPP  front end that interacts with all applications and connections. The MPP engine runs on control node to optimize and coordinate parallel queries. </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Compute Node -> provide computational power for analytics. separated from storage nodes. the are scaled using data warehouse units (DWU) </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> DWU -> Analytic resources that are provisioned. cobmination of cpu, memory, io. can be scaled down or up.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Data Movement Services (DMS) -> data transport technology that coordinate data movements between compute nodes. when sql warehouse runs a query, the work is divided into 60 smaller queries that run in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Storage node -> separate from compute in order to keep data at rest. cheaper that data being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing data distribution for sql data warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Replicated tables -> mostly used with small tables, have an instace caching on each of the compute nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Round robin -> distributed data evenly across the table without additional optimization. rewquires resuffling, takes time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Hash distibuted table -> A hash function is used to assign each row to one distibution deterministically. used for large tables, best with joins and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Partitioning the data in data warehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> helps in dividing data into smaller groups\n",
    " -> improve efficiency and performance of loading data by use of partition deletion, switching and merging.\n",
    " -> usually data is partitioned on a date column tied to when the data is loaded into the database\n",
    " ->can also be used to improve query performance\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Clustered Columnstore -> updateable primary storage method. great for read only.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Clustered Index -> An index that is physically stored in the same order as the data being indexed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Heap -> Data is not in any particular order. use when data has no natural order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<li> Sizing Partitions : creating a table with too many partitions can hurt performance under some circumstance.\n",
    "-> usually a successful partitioning scheme has 10 or a few hundred partitions.\n",
    "-> Clustered Columnstore tables -> it is important to consider how many rows belong to each partition.\n",
    "-> Before partitions are created, sql data warehouse already divides each table into 60 distributed databases.\n",

    "2. connect to data warehouse\n",
    "3. Prepare data warehouse to load data \n",
    "4. Examine configuration settings and tasks in the portal.\n",
